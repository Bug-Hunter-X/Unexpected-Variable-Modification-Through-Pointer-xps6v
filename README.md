This repository contains a simple C program that exhibits unexpected behavior due to pointer manipulation. The program initializes an integer variable and then modifies its value indirectly through a pointer. The solution demonstrates a proper way to handle pointers to avoid unexpected behavior.  This highlights the importance of understanding pointer arithmetic and memory management in C.
